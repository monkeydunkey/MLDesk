A framework for building machine learning system

This is an attempt at building a framework for building machine learning systems. Following are the aims of the frame
1. Increase in reuse of written code and reduce the use of `glue code` in building ML pipeline
2. A configuration based approach to building the defining ML pipeline
3. Provide tools for setting up unit test cases
4. Provide tools for monitoring the data pipeline and the model results


## Test Suite


## Performance Monitoring tools
